Zoom in of our robot with a zoom transition to the workshop with animated people diving into the ftc robot challenge
Jump into the water
Comes onto the field
Zoom into robot (we’re working on it)
Come out of water
FTC logo and team number and maybe LOAD logo
Robotic fish
Diver, swims around coral reef but all life is robotic
Coral reef spells LOAD
Zoom out of water to see aerial view of reef that is shaped like the LOAD letters with robotic pelicans and stuff
Air force song but changed to be about the ocean
Load robotics to the tune of baby shark
Everyone turns into robots like the pirates movie and falls into the water
Dogs playing poker but they’re robots and underwater
